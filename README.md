# Ümit Özkul — Tech Generalist & Digital Tinkerer

Welcome to my digital corner.

I’m Ümit — a self-taught, relentlessly curious builder, fixer, translator, and digital investigator. I didn't take the conventional path into tech. I took the longer one: full of experiments, reverse engineering, scripting chaos into order, and sometimes breaking things just to learn how to put them back together better.

### 💡 What I Do

- 🧠 **Build & Automate**: I write AHK scripts, custom GUI tools, and automate repetitive tasks. If there’s a faster way, I’ll find it.
- 🧪 **Test & Break Things**: I run malware tests in VMs, reverse sketchy scripts, disable system restrictions, and create my own tools to stress-test ideas.
- 🌐 **Translate & Document**: I’ve translated 20+ projects (including scientific documentaries) and maintain an offline personal knowledge base.
- 🛠️ **Rescue & Troubleshoot**: From USB virus file recovery to reviving “dead” laptops, I’ve solved problems others walked away from.
- 🎮 **Create for the Future**: I’m currently developing a solo game project and still design offline HTML/C++/WordPress sites for fun.

### 🧷 Work Ethic in 3 Words
**Learn. Hack. Repeat.**

This GitHub houses my experiments, tools, projects, and archives — a sandbox of ideas that shaped me into the person I am.

You won't see corporate gloss here. You’ll see real work. Quiet wins. Raw potential.
